/**
 * @title ChainBridgeXCAmpleGateway
 * @dev This contract is deployed on the satellite EVM chains eg). tron, acala, near etc.
 *
 *      It's a pass-through contract between the ChainBridge handler contract and
 *      the xc-ample controller contract.
 *
 *      When rebase is transmitted across the bridge,
 *      It forwards the next rebase report to the xc-ample controller.
 *
 *      When a sender initiates a cross-chain AMPL transfer from a
 *      source chain to a recipient on the current chain (target chain)
 *      the xc-amples are mint into the recipient's wallet.
 *      The amount of tokens to be mint is calculated based on the globalAMPLSupply
 *      on a source chain at the time of transfer and the,
 *      globalAMPLSupply recorded on the current chain at the time of minting.
 *
 *      When a sender initiates a cross-chain AMPL transfer from the current chain (source chain)
 *      to a recipient on a target chain, chain-bridge executes the `validateAndBurn`.
 *      It validates if the total supply reported is consistent with the recorded on-chain value
 *      and burns xc-amples from the sender's wallet.
