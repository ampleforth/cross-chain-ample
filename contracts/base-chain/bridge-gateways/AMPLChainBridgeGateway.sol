/**
 * @title AMPLChainBridgeGateway: AMPL-ChainBridge Gateway Contract
 * @dev This contract is deployed on the base chain (Ethereum).
 *
 *      It's a pass-through contract between the ChainBridge handler contract and
 *      the Ampleforth policy and the Token vault.
 *
 *      The contract is owned by the ChainBridge handler contract.
 *
 *      When rebase is transmitted across the bridge, It checks the consistency of rebase data
 *      from the ChainBridge handler contract with the recorded on-chain value.
 *
 *      When a sender initiates a cross-chain AMPL transfer from the
 *      current chain (source chain) to a target chain through chain-bridge,
 *      `validateAndLock` is executed.
 *      It validates if total supply reported is consistent with the
 *      recorded on-chain value and locks AMPLS in a token vault.
 *
 *      When a sender has initiated a cross-chain AMPL transfer from a source chain
 *      to a recipient on the current chain (target chain),
 *      chain-bridge executes the `unlock` function.
 *      The amount of tokens to be unlocked to the recipient is calculated based on
 *      the globalAMPLSupply on the source chain, at the time of transfer initiation
 *      and the total ERC-20 AMPL supply on the current chain, at the time of unlock.
