/**
 * @title TokenVault
 * @dev This is a holder contract for Tokens which will be deployed on the base chain (Ethereum).
 *
 *      When a user transfers Tokens from the base to a satellite chain
 *      Tokens are 'locked' in this vault contract
 *      and 'bridge-secured' Tokens (xc-tokens) are 'mint' on the satellite chain.
 *      This vault contract transfers Tokens from the depositor's wallet to itself.
 *
 *      When a user transfers xc-tokens from a satellite chain back to the base chain
 *      through a chain-bridge instance, xc-tokens are 'burnt' on a satellite chain
 *      and locked Tokens are 'unlocked' from this vault contract on the base chain.
 *      The vault contract transfers Tokens from itself to the recipient's wallet.
 *
 *      The vault owner curates a list of bridge-gateways which are allowed to
 *      lock and unlock tokens.
